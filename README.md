# Twitterify

Twitterify is an application I developed as part of a personal project that aims to automate Twitter accounts' behaviour and growth.

Includes features like tweet scraping from similar accounts to yours, auto following, unfollowing and auto retweet to increase account's exposure to reach more people in the target audience and get more followers.

Also, it uses OpenAI GPT-3 to write original content based on the previosuly scraped tweets and generate genuine responses to other creators' tweets to also increase engagement and exposure.

The idea of this project was to create an application in which I could create and run multiple Twitter accounts and not having to spend much time maintaining each one of them. This goal was reached.

P.S.: Because of a "technical restriction" I had to create most of the application in a single file. I would have done it differently if I could.
